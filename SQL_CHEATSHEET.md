## üöÄ Performance Patterns

### Cache Table
```sql
CACHE TABLE zones;
CACHE TABLE large_points;
```

### Broadcast Small Table

SELECT /*+ BROADCAST(small_table) */
    large.id,
    small.name
FROM large_table large
JOIN small_table small ON ST_Contains(small.geom, large.geom)
```

### Bounding Box Pre-filter
```sql
SELECT *
FROM large_features f
JOIN zones z 
    ON ST_Intersects(ST_Envelope(z.geom), ST_Envelope(f.geom))
    AND ST_Contains(z.geom, f.geom)
```

SELECT 
    zone_name,
    COUNT(*) / ST_Area(zone_geom) as density
FROM zones z
LEFT JOIN points p ON ST_Contains(z.zone_geom, p.point_geom)
GROUP BY zone_name, zone_geom
```

### Compactness
```sql
SELECT 
    zone_id,
    ST_Perimeter(zone_geom) / ST_Area(zone_geom) as compactness
FROM zones
```

### Distance to Nearest Feature
```sql
SELECT 
    p.id,
    MIN(ST_Distance(p.geom, f.geom)) as nearest_distance
FROM points p
CROSS JOIN features f
GROUP BY p.id
```

## üéØ Coordinate Accessors

### Extract Coordinates
```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    ST_X(point_geom) as longitude,
    ST_Y(point_geom) as latitude
FROM locations
```

### Bounding Box
```sql
SELECT 
    ST_XMin(geom) as min_lon,
    ST_YMin(geom) as min_lat,
    ST_XMax(geom) as max_lon,
    ST_YMax(geom) as max_lat
FROM zones
```

## üíæ Export Formats

### As Text (WKT)
```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    ST_AsText(geom) as wkt_geom

## üîß Tips

1. **Distance in degrees**: ~0.01¬∞ ‚âà 1 km at mid-latitudes
2. **Coordinate order**: ST_Point(lon, lat) not (lat, lon)
3. **Always filter nulls**: Add `WHERE geom IS NOT NULL`
4. **Use topology preservation**: `ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology()` over `ST_Simplify()`
5. **Cache small tables**: Use `CACHE TABLE` for dimension tables
6. **Broadcast joins**: Add `/*+ BROADCAST(table) */` hint for small tables
