# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Must Re-Run Setup Cells!

## The Error You're Seeing

```
Column `t`.`pickup_geom` cannot be resolved
```

## Why This Happens

The `taxi_trips` view in Spark's memory is from an **old run** of the notebook that didn't have the `pickup_geom` columns.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Re-Run the Setup Cells

You MUST re-run these cells in order:

### **Step 1: Run Cell #3** (Spark Initialization)
```python
# Initialize Spark with optimized configuration...
spark = SparkSession.builder...
```

### **Step 2: Run Cell #5** (Data Generation)
```python
# Generate NYC taxi trip data...
def generate_nyc_taxi_data(num_trips=100000):
```

### **Step 3: Run Cell #6** (‚ú® THE CRITICAL ONE)
```python
# Complex Spatial ETL Operations
taxi_df.createOrReplaceTempView("taxi_trips_raw")

spatial_trips = spark.sql("""
    SELECT 
        ...
        ST_Point(pickup_lon, pickup_lat) as pickup_geom,  # ‚Üê Creates this!
        ST_Point(dropoff_lon, dropoff_lat) as dropoff_geom,  # ‚Üê And this!
        ...
    FROM taxi_trips_raw
""")

spatial_trips.createOrReplaceTempView("taxi_trips")  # ‚Üê Overwrites old view!
```

### **Step 4: Run Cell #8** (Zones Creation)
```python
# Create NYC borough-like zones...
spatial_zones = spark.sql(...)
```

## üéØ Quick Fix

**Option 1: Restart Kernel and Run All**
1. In Jupyter: `Kernel` ‚Üí `Restart & Run All`
2. Wait for all cells to complete

**Option 2: Re-run Setup Manually**
1. Run Cell #3 (Spark init)
2. Run Cell #5 (Data generation)
3. Run Cell #6 (Spatial ETL - **MUST DO THIS!**)
4. Run Cell #8 (Zones)
5. Now try running Section 8+ cells again

## What Cell #6 Does Now

After the fix, Cell #6 creates these columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pickup_point` | Geometry for sections 1-7 |
| `dropoff_point` | Geometry for sections 1-7 |
| `pickup_geom` | Geometry for sections 8-18 ‚ú® |
| `dropoff_geom` | Geometry for sections 8-18 ‚ú® |

## Verification

After re-running Cell #6, you can verify the columns exist:

```python
# Run this in a new cell
spark.sql("DESCRIBE taxi_trips").show(100, False)
```

You should see:
- ‚úÖ `pickup_geom` (geometry)
- ‚úÖ `dropoff_geom` (geometry)
- ‚úÖ `pickup_point` (geometry)
- ‚úÖ `dropoff_point` (geometry)

---

**TL;DR**: The view is cached in memory from an old run. **Re-run Cell #6** to recreate it with the geometry columns!
